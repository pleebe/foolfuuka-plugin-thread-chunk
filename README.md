# FoolFuuka Plugin Thread Chunk
Show threads in chunks. Provided as is. No warranty implied nor provided.

Adds board route to 
```
/$shortnam/chunk/$thread_num/
```
By default it shows 500 posts at a time, but you can specify less or more posts with the url like this
```
/$shortnam/chunk/$thread_num/1000/
```
And changing pages works with one additional number (starting from 0) like this
```
/$shortnam/chunk/$thread_num/1000/1/
```
The page also shows how many posts are left and lets you load more posts at the bottom.
